1. Create a model by starting the GraphWalker Studio in terminal
    - Locate your GraphWalker-studio file
    - Make sure that you are in that directory when you run it with the following command
    - java -jar graphwalker-studio-4.3.0.jar
    - Open your browser and type: http://localhost:9090/studio.html
    - When you are done with your graph, you can download it. Standard download folder is your "Downloads"
      and the name is "test.json"

2. Start the RESTful service
    - Locate your GraphWalker-cli file
    - Make sure that you are in that directory when you run it with the following command
    - java -jar graphwalker-cli-4.3.0.jar -d all online -s RESTFUL -m C:\path\to\model.json "random(length(10))"
    - You should now see the model loaded and it should say "Press control+C to end..."
